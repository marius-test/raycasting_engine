# raycasting_engine

This project demonstrates a basic 3D raycasting engine inspired by early first-person shooters like *Wolfenstein 3D*.

It’s built in **Python** using **pygame** and serves as a learning tool to understand raycasting and 3D simulation concepts.

The project currently contains some bugs and is a prototype that I may expand on into a full game in the future.
